# ðŸ“¦ AutoInventory
**A Fully Automated, Intelligent Warehouse Management System**  

---

## **Project Description**  
AutoInventory is an end-to-end, event-driven warehouse management solution that addresses real-world FMCG inventory challenges. The system integrates real-time data streaming, predictive analytics, and interactive dashboards to optimize inventory levels, prevent stockouts, and reduce wasteâ€”all with zero manual intervention.

## **Dataset**  
This project uses a simulated FMCG dataset, enriched with:  
- **Sales Metrics:** Sales volume, price, and promotion data.  
- **Inventory Metrics:** Stock levels and replenishment lead times.  
- **Temporal Components:** Date, weekday, and month.  
- **Geospatial Information:** Store locations and product categories.  
- **Dataset Link:** [FMCG Sales Demand Forecasting Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishanukalita/fmcg-sales-demand-forecasting-and-optimization/data)

## **Architecture and Technologies Used**  
### **Architecture**  
1. **Data Streaming:** Kafka (running in Docker) streams inventory data into S3.  
2. **ETL Pipeline:** Glue processes data, and Lambda triggers transformations dynamically.  
3. **Data Warehousing:** Redshift stores analytical-ready data.  
4. **Dashboards:** Streamlit and Power BI provide interactive visualizations.

## **Project Implementation**  
### **Step 1: Real-Time Data Streaming**  
- **Technology Used:** Apache Kafka (deployed with Docker)  
- Simulates real-time inventory updates by streaming data from sales points to AWS S3 as a centralized data lake.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Ensures idempotency with custom logic.  
  - Handles hourly batching for efficient ingestion.

### **Step 2: ETL Pipeline**  
- **Technologies Used:** AWS Glue and Lambda  
- **ETL Highlights:**  
  - Extracts raw data from S3 and applies transformations like revenue, cost, and profit margin calculations.  
  - Processes and loads transformed data into AWS Redshift for analytical queries.  
- **Event-Driven:** Automatically triggered by S3 file uploads using Lambda.  

### **Step 3: Predictive Analytics**  
- **Technology Used:** PyTorch custom Neural Network Models  
- Forecasts sales and stock levels 5â€“7 days into the future.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Rolling forecasts for stability.  
  - Advanced preprocessing with outlier resistance and missing data handling.  
  - Automatic model retraining for evolving data patterns.  

### **Step 4: Dashboards and Insights**  
- **Technologies Used:** Streamlit and Power BI  
- **Streamlit:** Provides forecasting, historical data line graphs, and basic insights in real time.

- **Power BI:** Offers interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities by store location and product category, and advanced visuals for current stock levels, replenishment times, and revenue trends.
